        <p><strong>SentimentSift</strong> is an AI-powered platform designed to filter emotional biases from online reviews and provide objective, fact-based insights for consumers and businesses. SentimentSift also providing a curated list of reliable food bloggers. For each trusted blogger, the platform displays a comprehensive list of all restaurants they&#39;ve previously visited and reviewed, creating a reliable recommendation network that users can trust.</p>
<p>A restaurant owner saying that those who gave the restaurant one-star negative reviews were all saying it took too long to wait, not that the food was bad. So there is an API that can capture the reviews of this store, and then throw it into AI analysis, there should be different results.</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>In the competitive restaurant industry, customer reviews and social media feedback play a crucial role in shaping perceptions and influencing dining decisions. However, the absence of a unified system to normalize ratings across platforms and extract actionable insights from unstructured data creates challenges for restaurant owners, customers, and market researchers. Reviews often reflect biases and lack a consolidated evaluation of key aspects such as food, service, and ambiance.</p>
<p>This project aims to address these challenges by developing a tool that consolidates customer feedback from multiple platforms, performs sentiment analysis on reviews, and generates a normalized rating system based on three critical aspects: <strong>Food</strong>, <strong>Service</strong>, and <strong>Ambiance</strong>. Additionally, the project integrates an interactive chatbot powered by <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> and <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> to provide precise, context-aware responses to user queries.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Objective</strong></h2>
<p>The goal is to deliver actionable insights to stakeholders through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restaurant Owners</strong>: Brief reports summarizing trends observed in high-performing restaurants.</li>
<li><strong>Customers</strong>: Consolidated, unbiased ratings for informed dining decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Market Researchers</strong>: Insights into dining trends and customer preferences.</li>
<li>An advanced chatbot capable of answering specific questions about restaurants (e.g., cuisine type, amenities, operating hours) using RAG and LLM integration.</li>
</ul>
