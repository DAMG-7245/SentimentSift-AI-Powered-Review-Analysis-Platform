## **SentimentSift**

### **Introduction**
SentimentSift is a data-driven tool designed to transform unstructured customer feedback into actionable insights for the restaurant industry. By consolidating reviews and ratings from multiple platforms, the tool generates a normalized rating system based on three critical aspects: **Food**, **Service**, and **Ambiance**. 

Additionally, SentimentSift integrates an advanced chatbot powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to provide precise, context-aware responses to user queries. This project aims to empower restaurant owners, customers, and market researchers with unbiased insights and interactive tools for better decision-making.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Normalize ratings across platforms; clean text; add metadata.

3. Data Storage:
   - Store raw JSON files in Amazon S3; stage preprocessed data in Snowflake.

4. Sentiment Analysis & Theme Extraction:
   - Use PyABSA for aspect-based scoring; feed labeled text into BERTopic.

5. Vector Embedding Storage:
   - Store embeddings with metadata in Pinecone.

6. Chatbot Integration:
   - Use LangChain & GPT-4 to build a RAG-powered chatbot for advanced queries.

7. Visualization & Querying:
   - Develop Streamlit UI for querying trends and visualizing insights.
